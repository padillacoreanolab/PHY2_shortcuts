# SLEAP_shortcuts
A very small Repo that has some examples of shortcuts we can use for PHY2 so users do not have to use the terminal every time. 

## Windows:
* Make sure Anaconda is installed for all users of the device.
* Copy the `PHY2.bat` file into `C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\Scripts`
* Copy the `PHY2.Ink` shortcut over to the desktop or wherever you want to access PHY2 from.
